# Test Format
# 1) Lines that begin with '#' are ignored.
# 2) Blank lines are ignored.
# 3) Each test case must be on a single line. No line-end comments are allowed.
# 4) A test case consists of a comma-seperated line with 5 values:
#        - Direction (0 for Lat/Lon to SVY21, 1 for SVY21 to Lat/Lon)
#        - Input #1
#        - Input #2
#        - Expected #1
#        - Expected #2
#
# Example:
1, 39105.269, 30629.967, 1.3699278977737488, 103.85695034976466

# Backward conversion with the above example:
0, 1.3699278977737488, 103.85695034976466, 39105.269, 30629.967

# Error Handling
# 1) Only lines that contain exactly 5 tokens are considered test cases. 
#    All other lines are ignored, even if they are not empty, or do not start with '#'.
# 2) In a test case, tokens are assumed to be in the correct format. Incorrect formats
#    are not handled by this TestDriver.
