# Test Format
# 1) Lines that begin with '#' are ignored.
# 2) Blank lines are ignored.
# 3) Each test case must be on a single line. No line-end comments are allowed.
# 4) A test case consists of a comma-seperated line with 5 values:
#        - Direction    (0 for Lat/Lon to SVY21, 1 for SVY21 to Lat/Lon)
#        - Input #1     (Northing/Latitude)
#        - Input #2     (Easting/Longitude)
#        - Expected #1  (Latitude/Northing)
#        - Expected #2  (Longitude/Easting)
#
# Example:
1, 39105.269, 30629.967, 1.3699278977737488, 103.85695034976466

# Backward conversion with the above example:
0, 1.3699278977737488, 103.85695034976466, 39105.269, 30629.967

# Error Handling
# 1) Only lines that contain exactly 5 tokens are considered test cases. 
#    All other lines are ignored, even if they are not empty, or do not start with '#'.
# 2) In a test case, tokens are assumed to be in the correct format. Incorrect formats
#    are not handled by this TestDriver.

# SVY21 Reference Point
1, 38744.572, 28001.642, 1.366666, 103.833333
0, 1.366666, 103.833333, 38744.572, 28001.642

# The following cases test the accuracy of SVY21->Lat/Lon conversion.
# Each SVY21 coordinate is a corner of a protected place gazetted in:
# http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=Id%3A%223ed25f04-0465-4eda-b05f-c0c7334e8840%22%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0;whole=yes
# Its corresponding Lat/Lon coordinate is computed once, and if its location when viewed on
# Google Maps matches the shape of the gazetted plot of land, it is considered to be
# 'correct'.
